==============================

Peer project for Samsung Phone tidy data of means of the
'mean' and 'std' variables by subject and activity.

Tidy data was produced by running the run_analysis.R script
found in this repo. Each code step was specified separately,
to make the code easier for the reader to follow.

That script documents each step involved from reading in the
'raw' data to creation of  the final data set.

Note the discussion of 'wide' vs 'narrow' tidy data in
the course Discussion Forum. Option here was for the 'wide' version
of tidy data, since the further use of this dataset is unknown.

Each variable forms a column. Each observation forms a row.
Each type of observational unit forms a table. Column headers
are names, not values. Every column contains a different 
variable etc.
