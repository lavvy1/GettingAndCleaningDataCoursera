## codebook for dataset smarphones_by_subject_and_activity
#############################################################

Variables
=========
subject: Coded as 1 to 30.
	 Taken from the row concantenation of datasets subject_train and subject_test. 

activity: values: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
	  Taken from dataset activity_labels.txt and merged via variable V1
	  into concatination of datasets 'test_y' and 'train_y'.

All variables below were taken from train_x and test_x. The variable names were merged
	  in from dataset 'features'.
          The meaning of each original variable is described in:
          http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

	  The original 561 variables were transformed as follows:
	  - only the variables with 'Mean', 'mean' or 'std' in their original name were kept.
	       This left 86 variables in the dataset, besides 'subject' and 'activity', which were added later.
	  - The following strings '-', '(', ')' were deleted from the variable names
	  - If a name began with 't', the 't' was changed to 'time'.
	  - If a name began with 'f', the 'f' was changed to 'frequency'
	  - No other changes were made to the column names, since the length of some of these names is already long.
     	  - The variables below were created by taking the means of the original variables, grouped by subject and activity.
               Note that these variables were already the standardized means or standard deviations
	       of the raw data as described in:
               http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones


The variable names are listed below along with their order in the dataset 'smarphone_by_subject_and_activity',
shown on the left hand side below.
